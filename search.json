    "text": "There are increasing demands on scientific staff in preparing reports for governmental and public dissemination, as well as scientific dissemination. Creating reports is a time-consuming task, as it often requires switching between programs for writing, doing analyses and creating tables and figures, as well as other graphical and textual programs. Learning efficient tools in combining programming and report generation are becoming increasingly important to alleviate the manual and burdensome process of switching programs. Quarto is a second generation report framework based on the popular markdown plain text format. Combining writing in markdown with the ability to run code to format, analyse, and visualise data, all in the same place, creates a seamless environment for the researchers to produce reports. While this workshop will focus on using Quarto with R, it also has native abilities to interact with python, observable.js and Julia, without needing R installed. This makes Quarto a great tool to learn, no matter which language you focus on."

Click it and you should see some action in a new tab called “Background jobs”. It will call on latex and maybe install some latex packages to create your document.

Have them delete that and try again. Once fixed, that can switch back to the visual editor. - If the learner knows a lot of plain markdown, they can also just use the source editor, but I find that the visual editor is a good way to get started. I usually switch between the two a lot."
