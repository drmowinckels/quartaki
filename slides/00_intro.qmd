## Next generation R Markdown {.center}

> Quarto is a multi-language, [next-generation](https://quarto.org/docs/faq/rmarkdown.html) version of R Markdown from Posit, and includes dozens of new features and capabilities while at the same being able to render most existing Rmd files without modification.

## Multi-lingual {.center}

-   Create dynamic content with [Python](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/python.html), [R](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html), [Julia](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/julia.html), and [Observable](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/ojs.html).

-   Author documents as plain text markdown or [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks.

-   Publish high-quality articles, reports, presentations, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.

-   Author with scientific markdown, including equations, citations, crossrefs, figure panels, callouts, advanced layout, and more.

## IDE agnostic {.center}

-   [Journal article templates](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/listing-journals.html)

## Comprehensive online docs {.center}

-   [User guide](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/)

-   [Reference list](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/)

-   [Gallery of examples](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/)

-   [Blog with updates and show-cases](https://quarto.org/docs/blog/)

::: notes
Using these tools, you will be able to follow along everything I do, and I can help when things go wrong

If you choose another setup, you are very welcome to that. But I will not be able to help as easily (or set aside time to do so), and you will need to think of your own code examples in other languages.

# Markdown flavours

| Markdown type   | file extension | code chunks |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| Plain markdown  | `.md`          | no          |
| R markdown      | `.Rmd`         | yes         |
| Quarto markdown | `.qmd`         | yes         |

## What are code chunks?

Pieces of code that will be execute *on report rendering* to include output in the report.

::: columns
::: {.column width="32%"}
````         
``` {{r}}
#| label: code-example

hist(mtcars$mpg)
```
````
:::

::: {.column width="10%"}
:::

::: {.column width="58%"}
```{r}
#| label: code-example

hist(mtcars$mpg)
```
:::
:::

## What are code chunks?

These could also be *inline code* for incorporation into the text parts of a report.

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
### R Markdown \| Quarto

```{=html}
<div class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode markdown">
<code class="sourceCode markdown">
Number of observations: &#96;r nrow(mtcars)&#96; . 
</code>
</pre>
</div>
```
:::

::: {.column width="10%"}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
### Output

Number of observations: `r nrow(mtcars)`
:::
:::

## How does that work? {.center}

## R markdown vs. Quarto

Code chunks can be provided inside the code chunk

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**\`\`\`{r** echo = TRUE, message = FALSE **\`\`\`**
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**\`\`\`{r}**

#\| echo: true

#\| message: false

**\`\`\`**
